#Configuration

You may create as many configurations as you wish. Often no more than a development, productions and perhaps a local are required.

As the entire configuration is loaded and exposed in middleware you may wish to create custom properties/objects for use in middleware.

A minimal configuration file is created by default. To see a full list of options view the "active.json" file in this directory
after you have booted your application at least once.
