#Mixin
----

The mixin folder will concatenate your files into a single file called mixin.css and/or mixin.js respectively.

Any file structure will be ignored since the files are concatenated.

Mixin files will automatically be minified when running in production mode only. While in development mixin files are only concatenated for debugging purposes.
