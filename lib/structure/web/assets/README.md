#Assets
----

Assets are just that, assets that make your application do all the cool stuff it does. 

For example the assets folder contains sub directories which are explained below:

**framework** - stored your client side framework such as Angular, Backbone or Ember.

**minify** - all css/js files saved in this location will be minified and saved to their respective /public folders.

**mixin** - css/js files are concatenated into a single file called mixins.js and mixins.css respectively.

**preprocess** - here is where you'll store your .less or .sass files for preprocessing and compiling to css.
