#Minify

Minify will minify your .js or .css files automatically and output them to /public/js & /public/css respectively.

You may use sub-folders if you wish. The output structure will follow the structure you've specified.

Minify files will not actually be minified unless in a production environment. This is to ensure easier debugging while in development.
